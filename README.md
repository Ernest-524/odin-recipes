# odin-recipes
This is a project given by a website called the odin project.
This website teaches people about web development.
After completing the first lesson on HTML, they have asked me to make this project.
The project is about recipes.
A website about recipes.
Actually, I have done this before but I hope that this one bacomes better than the first one I did.
